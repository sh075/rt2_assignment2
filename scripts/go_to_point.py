#  Description: <BR>
#    This node allows the robot to reach a position with a given orientation.
#	 First, it orients the robot in the direction of the goal and moves towards it.
#	 Once the robot has reached the correct x and y coordinates in the goal position, 
#	 it rotates to reach the correct orientation. Both angular and linear velocities are set by
#	 the node 'user_interface' and are received on the topic '/vel'. If the goal
# 	 is set cancelled by the client of the action server, then the velocities are
#	 all set to zero. The action server is then set preempted.
